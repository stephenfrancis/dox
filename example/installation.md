# Installation

1. Copy dox/index.html to your chosen repo of markdown documents (it can be named anything you like)
2. Ensure that:
  * All (relevant) folders of your repo (including the root folder) contain `README.md`
  * All (relevant) markdown documents in any folder are linked to by `README.md` of that folder
  * All (relevant) folders within a folder are linked to by `README.md` of that folder
  * All markdown documents have the suffix `.md`

In the above, "relevant" means the content you want to be accessible through the front-end. Folders and
documents that don't conform to the above will be silently ignored.
